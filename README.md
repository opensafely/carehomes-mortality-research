# Exploring the Increased Mortality in English Care Homes during the 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic 

This project is either no longer active or may be ongoing. Results in this repository MUST NOT be considered an accurate or valid representation of the study purpose. These data may reflect an incomplete or incorrect analysis with no further ongoing work. The repository content has ONLY been made public to support the OpenSAFELY open science and transparency principles and to support the sharing of re-usable code for other subsequent users. The results have not been peer-reviewed. No clinical, policy or safety conclusions must be drawn from any of the data here. 

* Author note: the project was paused due to challenges associated with identifying individuals residing in the same household, which is incomplete for large households covered by different EHR providers. There were also challenges associated with defining whether or not each household was a care home or private home, as the address data used to determine care home and household status by the cohort extractor is not the same. These challenges will be described in a short data report on household identification and household level analyses in OpenSAFELY (currently ongoing, lead is Kevin Wing. 

# About the OpenSAFELY framework

The OpenSAFELY framework is a new secure analytics platform for
electronic health records research in the NHS.

Instead of requesting access for slices of patient data and
transporting them elsewhere for analysis, the framework supports
developing analytics against dummy data, and then running against the
real data *within the same infrastructure that the data is stored*.
Read more at [OpenSAFELY.org](https://opensafely.org).

The framework is under fast, active development to support rapid
analytics relating to COVID19; we're currently seeking funding to make
it easier for outside collaborators to work with our system.  You can
read our current roadmap [here](ROADMAP.md).
